# MyInnoCars (Global Online Digital)

## Front-end coding test (React)

Our team's designer has come up with a new design to show our latest and greatest recharge cars on the website.

Here is how the design look like for desktop and mobile (files are stored under `docs` folder)

### Desktop

![ProductListDesktop](./docs/ProductList-Desktop.png)

### Mobile

![ProductListDesktop](./docs/ProductList-Mobile.png)

The data required to render the design is under `public/api/cars.json` folder. You need to fetch the data from the client side and render it in the browser. The data looks like this:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "xc90-recharge",
    "modelName": "XC90 Recharge",
    "bodyType": "suv",
    "modelType": "plug-in hybrid",
    "imageUrl": "/images/xc90_recharge.jpg"
  }
]
```

The product owner is telling you that you can generate the links to the learn and shop pages of each car by concatating the `id` of the car to the learn (`/learn/`) and shop (`/shop/`) urls.

Two extra SVG icons are also provided by our designer which are stored under `docs` folder.

## Requirements

- Need to implement this project using ReactJs.
- Browser support is modern ever-green browsers.
- Implement this design using React and Typescript.
- Accessibility is important.
- Code Structure and reusablity is important.

## Bonus Points:

- If you use implement the solution using React NextJS Framework (https://nextjs.org/)
- If you add a filter bar on the top to filter cars by `bodyType`

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
